        <h2>The SQL Inner Join</h2>
        <p>The SQL Inner Join is a type of join that combines multiple tables by retrieving records that have matching values in both tables (in the common column).</p>
        <p>It compares each row of the first table with each row of the second table, to find all pairs of rows that satisfy the join-predicate. <br>
            When the join-predicate is satisfied, the column values from both tables are combined into a new table.</p>
        <img src="ij.png" height="20%" width="24%">
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        Following is the basic syntax of SQL Inner Join:<br>
        <pre>SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table1
            INNER JOIN table2
            ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;</pre>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Assume we have created a table named CUSTOMERS, which contains the personal details of customers including their name, age, address and salary etc.,<br>
             using the following query</p>
             <pre>CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
                ID INT NOT NULL,
                NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
                AGE INT NOT NULL,
                ADDRESS CHAR (25),
                SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),       
                PRIMARY KEY (ID)
             );</pre>
             Now insert values into this table using the INSERT statement as follows:<br>
             <pre>INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES
                (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
                (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
                (3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
                (4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
                (5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
                (6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
                (7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );</pre>
                The table will be created as:<br>
                <img src="ij1.png" height="35%" width="45%"><br>
                Let us create another table ORDERS, containing the details of orders made and the date they are made on.<br>
                <pre>CREATE TABLE ORDERS (
                    OID INT NOT NULL,
                    DATE VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
                    CUSTOMER_ID INT NOT NULL,
                    AMOUNT DECIMAL (18, 2)
                 );</pre>
                 Using the INSERT statement, insert values into this table as follows:<br>
                 <pre>INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES
                    (102, '2009-10-08 00:00:00', 3, 3000.00),
                    (100, '2009-10-08 00:00:00', 3, 1500.00),
                    (101, '2009-11-20 00:00:00', 2, 1560.00),
                    (103, '2008-05-20 00:00:00', 4, 2060.00);</pre>
                    The table is displayed as follows:<br>
                    <img src="ij2.png" height="24%" width="53%">
                    <p>Let us now combine these two tables using the Inner Join query as shown below:</p>
                    <pre>SELECT ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
                        FROM CUSTOMERS
                        INNER JOIN ORDERS
                        ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;</pre>
                    <h3>Output</h3>
                    The result of this query is obtained as follows:<br>
