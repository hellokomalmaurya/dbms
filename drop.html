        <h1>DROP Table</h1>
        <p>SQL provides command to DROP an existing table completely in a database. Once SQL DROP command is issued then there is no way back to recover the table including its data, 
            <br>so be careful before issuing this command in production system.</p>
        <h2>The SQL DROP Table Statement</h2>
        <p>The SQL DROP TABLE statement is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command that is used to remove a table's definition, and its data, 
            <br>indexes, triggers, constraints and permission specifications (if any).</p>
        <b>note:</b>
        <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
            <li >You should be very careful while using this command because once a table is<br>
                 deleted then all the information available in that table will also be lost forever.</li>
                 <li>If the table is partitioned, the statement removes the table definition, 
                    <br>all its partitions, all data stored in those partitions, and all partition definitions.</li>
                <li>To drop a table in a database, one must require ALTER permission on the said table and CONTROL permissions on the table schema.</li>
                <li>Even though it is a data definition language command, it is different from TRUNCATE TABLE statement as the DROP statement completely
                    <br> frees the table from the memory.</li>
                <li>DROP TABLE causes an implicit commit, except when used with the TEMPORARY keyword.</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        The basic syntax of this DROP TABLE statement is as follows:<br>
        <pre>DROP TABLE table_name;</pre>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        Assume we have created a table named CUSTOMERS using the CREATE TABLE statement as shown below:<br>
        <pre>CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
            ID          INT NOT NULL,
            NAME        VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
            AGE         INT NOT NULL,
            ADDRESS     CHAR (25),
            SALARY      DECIMAL (18, 2),
            PRIMARY KEY (ID)
         );</pre>
         Let us first verify the CUSTOMERS table using the DESC command then we will delete it from the database;<br>
         <pre>DESC Table</pre>
         If the table is created successfully the DESC command displays the structure of the table as shown below:<br>
         <img src="drop1.png" height="30%" width="55%">
         <p>This means that the CUSTOMERS table is available in the database, so let us now drop it as shown below.</p>
         <pre>DROP TABLE CUSTOMERS;</pre>
         <h3>Output</h3>
         The output is displayed as follows:<br>
         <pre>Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)</pre>
         <h3>Verification</h3>
         Now, to verify if the table is actually dropped, you can use the DESC CUSTOMERS command as shown:<br>
         <pre>DESC CUSTOMERS;</pre>
         Following error is displayed:<br>
         <pre>ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'tutorials.CUSTOMERS' doesn't exist</pre>
