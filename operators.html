        <h1>PL/SQL - Operators </h1>
        <p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulation. <br>
            PL/SQL language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators </p>
            <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
                <li >Arithmetic operators</li>
                <li>Relational operators</li>
                <li>Comparison operators</li>
                <li>Logical operators</li>
                <li>String operators</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
        <p>Following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by PL/SQL. Let us assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 5, then:</p>

        <h2>Relational Operators</h2>
        <p>Relational operators compare two expressions or values and return a Boolean result. Following table shows all the relational operators supported by PL/SQL.<br>
             Let us assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:</p>
            <img src="op2.png" height="60%" width="40%">
        <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
        <p>Comparison operators are used for comparing one expression to another. The result is always either TRUE, FALSE or NULL.</p>

        <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
        <p>Following table shows the Logical operators supported by PL/SQL. All these operators work on Boolean operands and <br>
            produce Boolean results. Let us assume variable A holds true and variable B holds false, then :</p>
        <img src="op4.png" height="40%" width="50%">
        <h2>PL/SQL Operator Precedence</h2>
        <p>Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. 
            <br>Certain operators have higher precedence than others; <br>
            for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.</p>
            <p>For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.</p>
            <p>Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. <br>
                Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.</p>
                <p>The precedence of operators goes as follows: =, <, >, <=, >=, <>, !=, ~=, ^=, IS NULL, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN.</p>
