        <h1>PL/SQL - Data Types</h1>
        <p>In this chapter, we will discuss the Data Types in PL/SQL. The PL/SQL variables, constants and parameters must have a valid data type,
            <br> which specifies a storage format, constraints, and a valid range of values.<br>
             We will focus on the <b>SCALAR</b> and the <b>LOB</b> data types in this chapter. The other two data types will be covered in other chapters.</p>
        <h2>PL/SQL Scalar Data Types and Subtypes</h2>
        PL/SQL Scalar Data Types and Subtypes come under the following categories:<br>

        <p>PL/SQL provides subtypes of data types. For example, the data type NUMBER has a subtype called INTEGER. You can use the subtypes in your<br>
            PL/SQL program to make the data types compatible<br>
            with data types in other programs while embedding the PL/SQL code in another program, such as a Java program.</p>
