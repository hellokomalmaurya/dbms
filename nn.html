        <h2>NULL Values</h2>
        <p>SQL uses the term NULL to represent a non-existent data value in the database. These values are not the same as an empty string or a zero.<br>
             They don't hold any space in the database and are used to signify the absence of a value or the unknown value in a data field.</p>
             Some common reasons why a value may be NULL:<br>
             <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
                <li >The value may not be provided during the data entry.</li>
                     <li>The value is not yet known.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the NULL values are basically non-existent, you cannot use comparison operators such as = , <, or > with them. However, <br>
                you can check if a value is NULL using the IS NULL, "NOT NULL" or IS NOT NULL operators.</p>
