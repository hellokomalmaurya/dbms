        <h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>
        <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language</li>
            <li>SQL lets you access and manipliate databases</li>
            <li>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Can SQL do?</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>SQL can execute queries against a database</li>
        <li>SQL can retrieve data from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can insert records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can update records in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can delete records from a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create new databases</li>
        <li>SQL can create new tables in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create stored procedures in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can create views in a database</li>
        <li>SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>RDBMS</h2>
        <p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
            <br><br>
            RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
            <br><br>
            The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
            <br><br>
            Look at the "Customers" table:
            <br><br>
            <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
            <font color="blue">SELECT</font> * <font color="blue">FROM</font> Customers;
            <br><br>
            Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. 
            <br><br>
            A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.
            <br><br>
            A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.
            <br><br>
            A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
