        <h2>Creating a Table from an Existing Table</h1>
            <p>nstead of creating a new table every time, one can also copy an existing table and its contents including its structure, into a new table.<br>
            This can be done using a combination of the CREATE TABLE statement and the SELECT statement.
            <br> Since its structure is copied, the new table will have the same column definitions as the original table.</p>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>The basic syntax for creating a table from another table is as follows:</p>
        <pre>CREATE TABLE NEW_TABLE_NAME AS
            SELECT [column1, column2...columnN]
            FROM EXISTING_TABLE_NAME
            WHERE Condition;</pre>
        <h3>Example: Creating Table from an Existing Table</h3>
        <p>Following is an example, which would create a table SALARY using the CUSTOMERS table and having the fields customer ID and customer SALARY</p>
        <pre>CREATE TABLE SALARY AS
            SELECT ID, SALARY
            FROM CUSTOMERS;</pre>
            This will create a new table SALARY which will have the following structure:<br>

        <h2>Listing Tables</h2>
        <p>You can use SQL <b>SHOW TABLES</b> statements in MySQL to list down all the tables available in a selected database.</p>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        Following is the syntax to list all the tables in SQL in MySQL<br>
        <pre>SHOW TABLES;</pre>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        Following is an example which will list down all the tables from a testDB database.<br>
        <pre>USE testDB;
            SHOW TABLES;</pre>
            This will display the following output depending on the number of tables available in your database.<br>
