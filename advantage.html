        <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
            <li >SQL is the standard database language and PL/SQL is strongly integrated with SQL. PL/SQL supports both static and dynamic SQL. <br>
                Static SQL supports DML operations and transaction control from PL/SQL block.<br>
                 In Dynamic SQL, SQL allows embedding DDL statements in PL/SQL blocks.</li><br><br>
                 <li>PL/SQL allows sending an entire block of statements to the database at one time. <br>
                    This reduces network traffic and provides high performance for the applications.</li><br><br>
                 <li>PL/SQL gives high productivity to programmers as it can query, transform, and update data in a database.</li><br><br>
                 <li>PL/SQL saves time on design and debugging by strong features, such as exception handling, <br>
                    encapsulation, data hiding, and object-oriented data types.</li><br><br>
                 <li>PL/SQL provides high security level.</li><br><br>
                 <li>PL/SQL provides access to predefined SQL packages.</li><br><br>
                 <li>Applications written in PL/SQL are fully portable.</li><br><br>
                 <li>PL/SQL provides support for Object-Oriented Programming.</li><br><br>
                 <li>PL/SQL provides support for developing Web Applications and Server Pages.</li><br><br>
