        <h2>SQL Wildcards</h2>
        <p>SQL Wildcards are special characters used as substitutes for one or more characters in a string. They are used with the LIKE operator in SQL, <br>to search for specific patterns in character strings or compare various strings.
        <br>
            The LIKE operator in SQL is case-sensitive, so it will only match strings that have the exact same case as the specified pattern.</p>
            Following are the most commonly used wildcards in SQL:<br>
            <img src="wildcard1.png" hieght="25%" width="40%">
            <p> The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters within a string. The underscore (_) represents a single character or number.<br>
             These symbols can also be used in combination to perform complex pattern searching and matching in SQL queries.</p>
             <h3>Syntax</h3>
             Following is the basic syntax to use wildcard characters:<br>
             <pre>SELECT * FROM table_name
                WHERE column_name LIKE [wildcard_pattern];</pre>
            <p>The following table demonstrates various ways of using wildcards in conjunction with the LIKE operator within a WHERE clause:</p>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            Firstly, let us create a table named CUSTOMERS using the following query:<br>
            <pre>CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
                ID INT NOT NULL,
                NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
                AGE INT NOT NULL,
                ADDRESS CHAR (25),
                SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),       
                PRIMARY KEY (ID)
             );</pre>
             The following INSERT query adds records into the CUSTOMERS table:<br>
             <pre>INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
                (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00),
                (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00),
                (3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00),
                (4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00),
                (5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00),
                (6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00),
                (7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00);</pre>
                The table will be created as:<br>
                <img src="wildcard3.png" hieght="35%" width="45%"><br>
                Here, we are displaying all the records from the CUSTOMERS table where the SALARY starts with 200.<br>
                <pre>SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY LIKE '200%';</pre>
                <h3>Output</h3>
                This would produce the following result.<br>
