        <h1>PL/SQL - Exceptions</h1>
        <p> An exception is an error condition during a program execution. PL/SQL supports programmers to catch such conditions using <b>EXCEPTION</b> block in <br>
            the program and an appropriate action is taken against the error condition. </p>
            There are two types of exceptions:<br>
            <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
                <li >System-defined exceptions</li>
                     <li>User-defined exceptions</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Syntax for Exception Handling</h2>
        <p>The general syntax for exception handling is as follows. Here you can list down as many exceptions as you can handle. <br>
            The default exception will be handled using <b>WHEN</b> others <b>THEN</b>:</p>
        <pre>DECLARE 
            declarations section
         BEGIN 
            executable command(s)
         EXCEPTION 
            exception handling goes here
            WHEN exception1 THEN  
               exception1-handling-statements  
            WHEN exception2  THEN  
               exception2-handling-statements  
            WHEN exception3 THEN  
               exception3-handling-statements 
            ........ 
            WHEN others THEN 
               exception3-handling-statements 
         END;</pre>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>DECLARE 
            c_id customers.id%type := 8; 
            c_name customerS.Name%type; 
            c_addr customers.address%type; 
         BEGIN 
            SELECT  name, address INTO  c_name, c_addr 
            FROM customers 
            WHERE id = c_id;  
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Name: '||  c_name); 
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Address: ' || c_addr); 
         
         EXCEPTION 
            WHEN no_data_found THEN 
               dbms_output.put_line('No such customer!'); 
            WHEN others THEN 
               dbms_output.put_line('Error!'); 
         END; 
         /</p>
         <p>When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt</p>
         <pre>No such customer!  
            PL/SQL procedure successfully completed. </pre>
        <p>The above program displays the name and address of a customer whose ID is given. Since there is no customer with ID value 8 in our database,<br>
             the program raises the run-time exception <b>NO_DATA_FOUND</b>, which is captured in the <b>EXCEPTION</b> block.</p>
             <h2>User-defined Exceptions</h2>
             <p>PL/SQL allows you to define your own exceptions according to the need of your program. A user-defined exception must be declared <br>
                and then raised explicitly, using either a RAISE statement or the procedure</p>
            <p>The syntax for declaring an exception is:</p>
            <pre>DECLARE 
                my-exception EXCEPTION; </pre>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <pre>DECLARE 
                c_id customers.id%type := &cc_id; 
                c_name customerS.Name%type; 
                c_addr customers.address%type;  
                -- user defined exception 
                ex_invalid_id  EXCEPTION; 
             BEGIN 
                IF c_id <= 0 THEN 
                   RAISE ex_invalid_id; 
                ELSE 
                   SELECT  name, address INTO  c_name, c_addr 
                   FROM customers 
                   WHERE id = c_id;
                   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Name: '||  c_name);  
                   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Address: ' || c_addr); 
                END IF; 
             
             EXCEPTION 
                WHEN ex_invalid_id THEN 
                   dbms_output.put_line('ID must be greater than zero!'); 
                WHEN no_data_found THEN 
                   dbms_output.put_line('No such customer!'); 
                WHEN others THEN 
                   dbms_output.put_line('Error!');  
             END; 
             /</pre>
             <p>When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result:</p>
             <pre>Enter value for cc_id: -6 (let's enter a value -6) 
                old  2: c_id customers.id%type := &cc_id; 
                new  2: c_id customers.id%type := -6; 
                ID must be greater than zero! 
                 
                PL/SQL procedure successfully completed. </pre>
                <h2>Pre-defined Exceptions</h2>
                <p>PL/SQL provides many pre-defined exceptions, which are executed when any database rule is violated by a program. For example, <br>
                    the predefined exception NO_DATA_FOUND is raised when a SELECT INTO statement returns no rows.</p>
