        <h1>PL/SQL - Cursors</h1>
        <p>A cursor is a pointer to this context area. PL/SQL controls the context area through a cursor. <br>
            A cursor holds the rows (one or more) returned by a SQL statement. The set of rows the cursor holds is referred to as the active set.</p>
        <p>You can name a cursor so that it could be referred to in a program to fetch and process the rows returned by the SQL statement, one at a time.<br>
            There are two types of cursors</p>
            <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
               <li >Implicit cursors</li>
               <li>Explicit cursors</li>
           </ul>
       <h2>Implicit Cursors</h2>
       <p>Implicit cursors are automatically created by Oracle whenever an SQL statement is executed, when there is no explicit cursor for the statement. <br>
           Programmers cannot control the implicit cursors and the information in it.</p>
       <p>Whenever a DML statement (INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE) is issued, an implicit cursor is associated with this statement. For INSERT operations, the cursor <br>
           holds the data that needs to be inserted. For UPDATE and DELETE operations, the cursor identifies the rows that would be affected.</p>
       <p>In PL/SQL, you can refer to the most recent implicit cursor as the SQL cursor, which always has attributes such as %FOUND, %ISOPEN, %NOTFOUND, and %ROWCOUNT.<br>
            The SQL cursor has additional attributes, %BULK_ROWCOUNT and %BULK_EXCEPTIONS, designed for use with the FORALL statement. </p>
           <p>The following table provides the description of the most used attributes:</p>

           <h3>Example</h3>
           <p>We will be using the CUSTOMERS 60%table we had created and used in the previous chapters.</p>
           <pre>Select * from customers;  

               +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 
               | ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   | 
               +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 
               |  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 | 
               |  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 | 
               |  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 | 
               |  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 | 
               |  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 | 
               |  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 | 
               +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+</pre>
       <p>The following program will update the table and increase the salary of each customer by 500 and use the SQL%ROWCOUNT attribute to determine the number of rows affected:</p>
       <pre>DECLARE  
           total_rows number(2); 
        BEGIN 
           UPDATE customers 
           SET salary = salary + 500; 
           IF sql%notfound THEN 
              dbms_output.put_line('no customers selected'); 
           ELSIF sql%found THEN 
              total_rows := sql%rowcount;
              dbms_output.put_line( total_rows || ' customers selected '); 
           END IF;  
        END; 
        /      </pre>
        When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result:<br>
        <pre>
           6 customers selected  

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed. 
        </pre>
        <p>If you check the records in customers table, you will find that the rows have been updated:</p>
        <pre>Select * from customers;  

           +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 
           | ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |

           |  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2500.00 |

           <h2>Explicit Cursors</h2>
           <p>Explicit cursors are programmer-defined cursors for gaining more control over the context area. An explicit cursor should be defined in the<br>
                declaration section of the PL/SQL Block. It is created on a SELECT Statement which returns more than one row.</p>
                The syntax for creating an explicit cursor is:
                <pre>CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement;</pre>
                Working with an explicit cursor includes the following steps:
                <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
                   <li >Declaring the cursor for initializing the memory</li>
                        <li>Opening the cursor for allocating the memory</li>
                        <li>Fetching the cursor for retrieving the data</li>
                        <li>Closing the cursor to release the allocated memory</li>
               </ul>
           <h2>Declaring the Cursor</h2>
           <p>Declaring the cursor defines the cursor with a name and the associated SELECT statement.</p>
           <h3>Example</h3>
           <pre>CURSOR c_customers IS 
               SELECT id, name, address FROM customers;</pre>
           <h2>Opening the Cursor</h2>
           <p>Opening the cursor allocates the memory for the cursor and makes it ready for fetching the rows returned by the SQL statement into it.<br>
                For example, we will open the above defined cursor as follows</p>
           <pre>OPEN c_customers; </pre>
           <h2>Fetching the Cursor</h2>
           <p>Fetching the cursor involves accessing one row at a time. For example, we will fetch rows from the above-opened cursor as follows:</p>
           <pre>FETCH c_customers INTO c_id, c_name, c_addr; </pre>
           <h2>Closing the Cursor</h2>
           <p>Closing the cursor means releasing the allocated memory. For example, we will close the above-opened cursor as follows:</p>
           <pre>
               CLOSE c_customers;
           </pre>
           <h3>Example</h3>
           <p></p>
           <pre>DECLARE 
               c_id customers.id%type; 
               c_name customers.name%type; 
               c_addr customers.address%type; 
               CURSOR c_customers is 
                  SELECT id, name, address FROM customers; 
            BEGIN 
               OPEN c_customers; 
               LOOP 
               FETCH c_customers into c_id, c_name, c_addr; 
                  EXIT WHEN c_customers%notfound; 
                  dbms_output.put_line(c_id || ' ' || c_name || ' ' || c_addr); 
               END LOOP; 
               CLOSE c_customers; 
            END; 
            /</pre>
               <p>When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result:</p>
