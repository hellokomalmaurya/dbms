        <h1>What is SQL View</h1>
        <p>A view in SQL is a virtual table that is stored in the database with an associated name. It is actually a composition of a table in the form of a predefined SQL query. 
            <br>A view can contain rows from an existing table (all or selected). A view can be created from one or many tables. Unless indexed, a view does not exist in a database.</p>
            <p>The data in the view does not exist in the database physically. A view is typically created by the database administrator and is used to:</p>
            <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
                <li >Structure data in a way that users or classes of users find natural or intuition.</li>
                     <li>Restrict access to the data in such a way that a user can see and (sometimes) modify exactly what they need and no more.</li>
                    <li>Summarize data from various tables which can be used to generate reports.</li>
            </ul> 
            <h2>The SQL CREATE VIEW Statement</h2>
            To create a view in a database, you can use the SQL CREATE VIEW statement.<br>
            <h3>Syntax</h3>
            <p>Following is the syntax of the SQL CREATE VIEW statement:</p>
            <pre>REATE VIEW view_name AS
                SELECT column1, column2....
                FROM table_name
                WHERE [condition];</pre>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>Assume we have created a table named CUSTOMERS using the <b>CREATE TABLE</b> statement using the following query</p>
            <pre>CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
                ID   INT              NOT NULL,
                NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
                AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
                ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
                SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),
                PRIMARY KEY (ID)
             );</pre>
             <p>Now, insert values into this table using the INSERT statement as follows :</p>
             <pre>INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES
                (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
                (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
                (3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
                (4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
                (5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
                (6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
                (7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );</pre>
                Following query creates a view based on the above created table:<br>
                <pre>CREATE VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW AS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;</pre>
                <h3>Verification</h3>
                You can verify the contents of a view using the select query as shown below:<br>
                <pre>SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_VIEW;</pre>
                The view is displayed as follows:<br>
                <img src="view.png" height="40%" width="55%">
                <h1>DROP or DELETE View</h1>
                <p>The SQL DROP VIEW statement is used to delete an existing view, along with its definition and other information. Once the view is dropped,
                    <br> all the permissions for it will also be removed. We can also drop indexed views with this statement.</p>
                    <ul style="background-color: rgb(247, 249, 199);" >
                        <li>While trying to perform queries, the database engine checks all the objects referenced in that statement are valid and exist.<br>
                             So, if a view does not exist in the database, the DROP VIEW statement will throw an error.</li>
                             <li>To drop a table in a database, one must require ALTER permission on the said table and CONTROL permissions on the table schema.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                The basic syntax of this DROP VIEW statement is as follows:<br>
                <pre>DROP VIEW view_name;</pre>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Assume we have created a table named CUSTOMERS using the CREATE TABLE statement using the following query</p>
                <pre>CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
                    ID   INT              NOT NULL,
                    NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
                    AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
                    ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
                    SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),
                    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
                 );</pre>
                 Now, insert values into this table using the INSERT statement as follows:<br>
                 <pre>INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES
                    (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 ),
                    (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
                    (3, 'Kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
                    (4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 ),
                    (5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 ),
                    (6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad', 4500.00 ),
                    (7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );</pre>
                    Assume we have created 3 views using the CREATE VIEW statement as shown below:<br>
                    <pre>CREATE VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW1 AS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
                        CREATE VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW2 AS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
                        CREATE VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW3 AS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;</pre>
                        You can verify the list of all the views using the following query:<br>
                    <pre>SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME 
                        FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS
                        WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='tutorials';</pre>
                        This will display the list of views as follows:<br>
                        <img src="view2.png" height="20%" width="45%">
                    <p>Now, lets drop two views from the above created views using the DROP VIEW statement.</p>
                    <pre>DROP VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW1;
                        DROP VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW2;</pre>
                    <h3>Verification</h3>
                    <p>Once we have deleted all the views if you try to retrieve the list of views you will get an empty set as shown below:</p>
                    <pre>SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME 
                        FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS
                        WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='tutorials';</pre>
                        The remaining list of views is as follows:<br>
                    <img src="view3.png" height="15%" width="50%">
